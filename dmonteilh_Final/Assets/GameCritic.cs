/* 1. I would say that the game is way too easy. I think that hitting the obstacles need to be a bit more punishing. Another reason I think the game is too easy is that it is just too slow.
   2. There should be a health system so that when you hit a obstacle you lose a point of health. The speed of the game could also gradually increse with how long you stay alive.
   3. I think a cool animation playing when you phase could give it a "wow" factor. The game could be zoomed out a little to show a cool skybox that has the same setting as the play area.
   4. It is fun to see how long I can keep a run going. It is nice to dodge and weave through the obstacles and collect the power ups.
   5. The speed of the game is defently very tedious. The movement is also another thing that is tedious with it feeling kind of floaty.

   I changed the obstacles to try and make them ghosts.
   For the powerup I changed the color of the particles and how they pop out of the sphere.
